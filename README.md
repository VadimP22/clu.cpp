# What is this?
This is transpiler. It accepts LLVM IR as input, and produces Lua as output.

# TODO
1. Research LLVM code generation for c++. Determine the correspondence of language constructs between C++ and Lua.
2. Based on the conclusions of the previous point, design an intermediate representation between LLVM IR and Lua.
3. Migrate project to CMake.
4. Refactor codebase.
